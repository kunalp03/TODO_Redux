Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Action Dispatched:**
   - When you call `dispatch(addTodo(task))` in `Task.jsx`, you are dispatching an action (`addTodo`) with a specific payload (in this case, the `task`).

2. **Middleware (if applicable):**
   - If you have middleware, such as Redux Thunk (`applyMiddleware(thunk)`), the action passes through it. Middleware can intercept and process actions before they reach the reducers. In your case, it might not have a significant impact as your actions seem to be synchronous.

3. **Reducers in `reducers/index.js`:**
   - The action reaches the root reducer, which is created by `combineReducers`. The root reducer is responsible for delegating the action to the appropriate individual reducer.

4. **Individual Reducer (`taskReducer` in your case):**
   - The individual reducer, such as `taskReducer`, receives the action. The reducer checks the action type and performs the corresponding logic. If the action type matches a case in the `switch` statement, it updates the state.

5. **Updated State:**
   - The reducer returns the updated state. This updated state is what gets stored in the Redux store.

6. **Connected Components Re-render:**
   - Components that are connected to the Redux store and are using `useSelector` to select parts of the state will be notified of the state change, causing them to re-render with the updated state.

So, in summary, when you dispatch an action, it goes through the middleware (if any), then through the root reducer, and finally, the individual reducer processes the action, updating the state in the Redux store. Components connected to the store re-render based on the updated state. The `store.js` file is where you create and configure the store, but it's the reducers that handle the logic of how the state changes in response to actions.
